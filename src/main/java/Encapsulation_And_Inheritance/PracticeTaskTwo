Create a class Shape and two derived classes Circle  and Rectangle.
Each derived class should inherit properties and methods from the base Shape class and have their own unique characteristics.
Shape Class have properties: color (String) - to store the color of the shape, and filled (enum FillType) - to indicate whether the shape is filled with color or not.
FillType should be an enum with values FILLED and NOT_FILLED. Add a constructor to initialize the properties.
Include a method called displayInfo() that prints the color of the shape and whether the shape is filled or not.
Circle Class  extends the Shape class and has property radius (double) - to store the radius of the circle.
Add a constructor to initialize filltype, color, and radius properties.
Override the displayInfo() and getArea() methods to display the information specific to the circle, including the radius, color, filltype and to calculate the area of a circle.
Add the function calculateCircumference(double PI, double r) to calculate circumference (2Ï€r)
and one more same method calculateCircumference(double r) where the PI will now be taken as a constant and not as a parameter.
You should also create a class called Rectangle that extends the Shape class as well and the class has properties
width (double) and height (double) - to store the width and height of the rectangle. Add a constructor to initialize the filltype,
color, width, and height properties. Override the displayInfo() and getArea() methods to display the information specific to the rectangle, including the width and height and its area.
In Main, create instances of the Circle and Rectangle classes and set their properties and call the displayInfo() method to display the information about each shape and fill types.
