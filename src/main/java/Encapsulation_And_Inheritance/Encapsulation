Encapsulation is first of four MAIN concepts in OOP and it is important for several reasons:
1. Data Hiding and Protection
Encapsulation allows you to hide an object's internal state and require all interaction to happen through its methods.
This helps protect the integrity of the object by preventing outside interference and misuse.
For instance, you can restrict access to certain parts of an object (e.g., making variables private) and only expose necessary parts through public methods (getters/setters).

2. Improved Modularity
Encapsulation divides a complex program into smaller, more manageable units (objects). Each object is responsible for its own state and behavior.
This separation makes the system easier to develop, debug, and maintain.

3. Flexibility and Maintainability
By controlling access to the object's internal state, you make the program more flexible.
If you want to change how the data is stored or represented, you only need to modify the internal methods, not the code that uses the object.
This makes future updates or bug fixes easier, as you can change an object’s internal implementation without breaking the rest of the program.

4. Prevents Unintended Consequences
Directly modifying an object's internal data from outside the object can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.
Encapsulation provides a controlled interface for accessing and modifying the data, reducing the chances of unintended side effects.

5. Reusability
Encapsulated objects are easier to reuse in different parts of a program or in different projects.
Since they expose only a limited, well-defined interface, you can confidently use them without worrying about their internal complexity.

6. Security
By exposing only the necessary methods and data, you can ensure that sensitive information remains private, preventing unauthorized access or changes to the object’s internal state.
