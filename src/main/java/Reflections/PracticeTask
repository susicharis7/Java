Create a Java program that demonstrates the use of reflection in the context of a student grade analysis system.
Define a Student class with attributes such as name, ID, and a list of grades. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes and
a method printInfo to display the student's information, including their ID, name, and grades.

Additionally, define a GradeAnalyzer class that takes an array of grades in its constructor
and provides methods for calculating the average grade (calculateAverage) and printing a summary (printSummary).

In the Start class instantiate a Student object with a name, ID, and an array of grades,
 and instantiate a GradeAnalyzer object using the same array of grades.
Use reflection to:
Access and print the field names and their values for both the GradeAnalyzer and Student classes.
Iterate through the declared methods of both classes and invoke those whose names start with calculate or print.
If the method has a non-void return type, print its result. For methods with a void return type, indicate that the method was invoked.
