Implement a Java program, Events, that generates a file containing simulated events and provides functionality to read and process the events.
The program should include the following functionalities:
Implement a method named generateEventsFile that takes a filename and the number of records as parameters.
This method generates a file with the specified number of event records, where each record contains:
Timestamp: A randomly generated timestamp in the format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.
Event Type: Randomly selected from a predefined array of event types ({"Login", "Logout", "Purchase", "ViewPage", "Error"}).
User ID: A random integer between 0 and 999.
Each event should be written to the file on a new line in the following format:
Timestamp | Event Type: <EventType> | User ID: <UserID>
Implement a method named printEventsFromFile that takes a filename as a parameter. This method reads events from the specified file and prints each event line to the console.
Implement a method named readEventsFromFile that takes a filename as a parameter and returns an ArrayList<String> containing all the event records from the file.
In the main method create an instance of the Events class and call the generateEventsFile method. Call the printEventsFromFile method to display the events from the file on the console.
Call the readEventsFromFile method to retrieve the event records.
