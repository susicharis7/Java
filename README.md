### This repository documents my learning and practice in Java, including:

✔️ **Fundamental concepts and logic through problem-solving**  
   - Includes exercises in **conditional statements, loops, functions, and logical thinking**  
   - Covers **fundamental programming concepts** essential for Java development  

✔️ **Object-Oriented Principles and their Practical Applications**  
   - Demonstrating the key concepts of OOP (**Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction**)  
   - **Design Patterns** for writing scalable and maintainable code  
   - **JUnit testing** for unit testing the code  

✔️ **More topics to deepen my understanding**
